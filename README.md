# CDK2 Activity Analysis Pipeline

A comprehensive Python-based tool for analyzing CDK2 activity in time-lapse microscopy images, based on the methodologies from Cappell et al., 2016 and the CDK2 activity calculation pipeline.

## Overview

This pipeline combines cell tracking algorithms with CDK2 activity calculation to provide comprehensive analysis of cell cycle dynamics. The tool processes time-lapse microscopy images to:

1. **Track individual cells** across multiple time frames
2. **Calculate CDK2 activity** based on fluorescence intensity ratios
3. **Analyze cell cycle dynamics** and activity patterns
4. **Generate comprehensive visualizations** and statistical reports

## Features

- **Automated cell detection and tracking** using watershed segmentation
- **CDK2 activity calculation** based on fluorescence intensity analysis
- **Statistical analysis** including clustering and transition detection
- **Comprehensive visualizations** with multiple plot types
- **Export capabilities** for further analysis
- **Configurable parameters** for different experimental setups
